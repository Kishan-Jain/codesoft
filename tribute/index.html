      <p>
        "Anna" Hazare <strong>(born : 15 June 1937)</strong> is an <strong> Indian social activist </strong>who led
        movements to promote rural development, increase government transparency, and investigate and punish corruption
        in public life. In addition to organising and encouraging grassroots movements, Hazare<strong>frequently
          conducted hunger strikes</strong> to further his causes—a tactic reminiscent, to many, of the work of Mahatma
        Gandhi. Hazare also contributed to the <strong>development and structuring of Ralegan Siddhi</strong>, a village
        in Parner taluka of Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, India. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan—the third-highest
        civilian award—by the Government of India in 1992 for<strong> his efforts in establishing this village as a
          model</strong> for others.
        <br /> Hazare started a hunger strike on 5 April 2011 to exert pressure on the Indian government to enact a
        stringent anti-corruption law, The Lokpal Bill, 2011 as envisaged in the<strong> Jan Lokpal Bill</strong>, for
        the institution of an ombudsman with the power to deal with corruption in public places. The fast led to
        nationwide protests in support. The fast ended on 9 April 2011, a day after the government accepted Hazare's
        demands. The government issued a gazette notification on the formation of a joint committee, consisting of
        government and civil society representatives, to draft the legislation.<br />

        Foreign Policy named him among top <strong>100 global thinkers</strong> in 2011. Also in 2011, Hazare was ranked
        as the most influential person in Mumbai by a national daily newspaper.He has faced criticism for his
        authoritarian views on justice, including death as punishment for corrupt public officials and his alleged
        support for forced vasectomies as a method of family planning.

      <h2>Early life</h2>
      <p>
        Kisan Baburao Hazare was born on 15 June 1937 in Bhingar, near Ahmednagar. He was the eldest son of Baburao
        Hazare and Laxmi Bai. He has two sisters and four brothers. He later adopted the name Anna, which in Marathi
        means <strong> "elder person" or "father".</strong><br />
        His father worked as an unskilled labourer in Ayurveda Ashram Pharmacy and struggled to support the family
        financially. In time, the family moved to their ancestral village of Ralegan Siddhi, where they owned a small
        amount of agricultural land. A relative took on the burden of providing Kisan with an education, taking him to
        Mumbai because the village had no primary school. The relative became unable financially to continue the support
        and Kisan's schooling ended in the Standard Seventh grade; his siblings never attended school. He started
        selling flowers at the Dadar railway station in Mumbai and eventually managed to own two flower shops in the
        city. He also became involved in vigilantism, joining groups who acted to prevent landlords' thugs from
        intimidating the poor out of their shelter.

      <h2>Military service</h2>
      <p>
        Hazare was drafted into the Indian Army in April 1960, where he initially worked as an army truck driver and was
        later attested as a soldier.[17] He undertook army training at Aurangabad.[14][18]

        During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Hazare was posted at the border in the Khem Karan sector. He was the sole
        survivor of an enemy attack—variously claimed to have been a bomb, an aerial assault and an exchange of fire at
        the border—while he was driving a truck.[14][15][19] The experiences of wartime, coupled with the poverty from
        which he had come, affected him. He considered suicide at one point but instead turned to pondering the meaning
        of life and death.[14] He said of the truck attack, "[It] sent me thinking. I felt that God wanted me to stay
        alive for some reason. I was reborn in the battlefield of Khem Karan. And I decided to dedicate my new life to
        serving people."[15] At a book stand in New Delhi railway station, he came across Swami Vivekananda's booklet
        "Call to the youth for nation building" which inspired him to think deeper. He spent his spare time reading the
        works of Swami Vivekananda, Gandhi, and Vinoba Bhave.[20] In a blog post, Hazare expressed his views on Kashmir
        by saying that it was his "active conviction that Kashmir is an integral part of India" and that if required
        once again for service, he would remain "ready to take part in war against Pakistan."[21]

        During his fifteen-year career in the army (1960–75),[17] Anna Hazare was posted at several locations, including
        Punjab (Indo Pak war 1965), Nagaland, Bombay (1971) and Jammu (1974).[22]

        During the Indo pak war, Hazare survived a road crash while driving for the army. He interpreted his survival as
        a further sign that his life was intended to be dedicated to service.[16] He had another escape in Nagaland,
        where one night, underground Naga rebels attacked his post and killed all the inmates. He had a miraculous
        escape as he had gone out to return nature's call and hence turned out to be the lone survivor.[23]

        Official records show that he was honourably discharged in 1975 after completing 12 years of service.[18]

      <h2>Transformation of Ralegan Siddhi</h2>
      <p>
        Hazare returned to Ralegan Siddhi, a village then described by Satpathy and Mehta as "one of the many villages
        of India plagued by acute poverty, deprivation, a fragile ecosystem, neglect and hopelessness."[24]

        Although most of the villagers owned some land, cultivation was extremely difficult due to the rocky ground
        preventing retention of the monsoon rains, this situation was worsened by gradual environmental deterioration as
        trees were cut down, erosion spread and droughts were also experienced. The shortage of water also led to
        disease from unsanitary conditions and water reuse for multiple purposes. The economy of the village had become
        reliant on the illegal manufacture and sale of alcohol, a product on which many of the villagers had become
        dependent. Many inhabitants borrowed from moneylenders to survive, paying monthly interest rates of as much as
        10%. Crime and violence (including domestic violence) had become commonplace, while education and employment
        opportunities were poor.[16][25]
        Hazare was relatively wealthy because of the gratuity from his army service. He set about using that money to
        restore a run-down, vandalised village temple as a focal point for the community. Some were able to respond with
        small financial donations but many other villagers, particularly among the elderly, donated their labour in a
        process that became known as shramdaan. Some youths also became involved in the work and these he organised into
        a Tarun Mandal (Youth Association). One of the works of Vivekananda which he had read was Call to the youth for
        nation building.[26]

      </p>
      <h3> Prohibition of alcohol </h3>
      <p>
        Hazare and the youth group decided to take up the issue of alcoholism to drive a process of reform. At a meeting
        conducted in the temple, the villagers resolved to close down liquor dens and ban alcohol in the village. Since
        these resolutions were made in the temple, they became, in a sense, religious commitments. Over thirty liquor
        brewing units voluntarily closed their establishments. Those who did not succumb to social pressure were forced
        to close their businesses when the youth group smashed their premises. The owners could not complain as their
        businesses were illegal.[27]

        Once 3 drunken villagers were tied to pillars and then flogged, personally by Hazare with his army belt. He
        justified this punishment by stating that "rural India was a harsh society",[28] and that

        Doesn't a mother administer bitter medicines to a sick child when she knows that the medicine can cure her
        child? The child may not like the medicine, but the mother does it only because she cares for the child. The
        alcoholics were punished so that their families would not be destroyed.[29]

        Hazare appealed to the government of Maharashtra to pass a law whereby prohibition would come into force in a
        village if 25% of the women in the village demanded it. In 2009 the state government amended the Bombay
        Prohibition Act, 1949 to reflect this.[30]

        It was decided to ban the sale of tobacco, cigarettes, and beedies (an unfiltered cigarette where the tobacco is
        rolled in tendu, also known as Coromandel ebony, leaves instead of paper) in the village. To implement this
        resolution, the youth group performed a unique "Holi" ceremony twenty two years ago.[when?] The festival of Holi
        is celebrated as a symbolic burning of evil. The youth group brought all the tobacco, cigarettes, and beedies
        from the shops in the village and burnt them in a Holi fire. Tobacco, cigarettes, or beedies are no longer
        sold.[31][32]
      </p>
      <h3>Grain Bank</h3>
      <p>
        In 1980, Hazare started the Grain Bank at the temple, with the objective of providing food security to needy
        farmers during times of drought or crop failure. Rich farmers, or those with surplus grain production, could
        donate a quintal to the bank. In times of need, farmers could borrow the grain, but they had to return the
        amount of grain they borrowed, plus an additional quintal as an interest. This ensured that nobody in the
        village ever went hungry or had to borrow money to buy grain. This also prevented distress sales of grain at
        lower prices at harvest time.[14]
      </p>
      <h3>Watershed development programme</h3>
      <p>
        Ralegan Siddhi is located in the foothills, so Hazare persuaded villagers to construct a watershed embankment
        and associated works to stop water and allow it to percolate and increase the ground water level and improve
        irrigation in the area. These efforts solved the problem of water scarcity in the village and made irrigation
        possible.[16][20]

        Cultivation of water-intensive crops like sugarcane was banned. Crops such as pulses, oilseeds, and certain cash
        crops with low water requirements replaced them. The farmers started growing high-yield varieties and changed
        cropping pattern. Hazare has helped farmers of more than 70 villages in drought-prone regions in the state of
        Maharashtra since 1975.[33] When Hazare came to Ralegan Siddhi in 1975 only 70 acres (28 ha) of land was
        irrigated, Hazare converted it into about 2,500 acres (1,000 ha).[27]
      </p>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        In 1932, Ralegan Siddhi got its first formal school, a single classroom primary school.[clarification needed] In
        1962, the villagers added more classrooms through community volunteer efforts. By 1971, out of an estimated
        population of 1,209, only 30.43% were literate (72 women and 290 men). Boys moved to the nearby towns of Shirur
        and Parner to pursue higher education, but girls were limited to primary education. Hazare, along with the youth
        of Ralegan Siddhi, worked to increase literacy rates and education levels. In 1976 they started a pre-school and
        a high school in 1979. The villagers formed a charitable trust, the Sant Yadavbaba Shikshan Prasarak Mandal,
        which was registered in 1979.[citation needed]
      </p>
      <h3>Removal of untouchability</h3>
      <p>
        The social barriers and discrimination that existed due to the caste system in India have been largely
        eliminated by Ralegan Siddhi villagers. It was Hazare's moral leadership that motivated and inspired the
        villagers to shun untouchability and caste discrimination. Marriages of Dalits are held as part of community
        marriage program together with those of other castes. The Dalits have become integrated into the social and
        economic life of the village. The upper caste villagers built houses for the lower caste Dalits by shramdaan and
        helped to repay their loans.
      </p>
      <h3>Gram Sabha</h3>
      <p>
        The Gandhian philosophy on rural development considers the Gram Sabha as an important democratic institution for
        collective decision-making in the villages of India.[37] Hazare campaigned between 1998 and 2006 for amending
        the Gram Sabha Act, so that villagers have a say in the village's development. The state government initially
        refused, but eventually gave in to public pressure. It became mandatory to seek the sanction of the Gram Sabha
        (an assembly of all village adults, and not just the few elected representatives in the gram panchayat) for
        expenditures on development works in the village.[30]

      <h2>Activism</h2>
      <h3>Anti-corruption protests in Maharashtra</h3>
      <p>
        In 1991 Hazare launched the Bhrashtachar Virodhi Jan Andolan (BVJA, People's Movement against Corruption), a popular movement to fight against corruption[38] in Ralegaon Siddhi. In the same year he protested against the collusion between 40 forest officials and timber merchants. This protest resulted in the transfer and suspension of these officials.[39]

        In May 1997 Hazare protested alleged malpractice in the purchase of powerlooms by the Vasantrao Naik Bhathya Vimukt Jhtra Governor P. C. Alexander.[40] On 4 November 1997 Gholap filed a defamation suit against Hazare for accusing him of corruption. He was arrested in April 1998 and was released on a personal bond of ₹5,000 (US$60).[41] On 9 September 1998 Hazare was imprisoned in the Yerawada Jail to serve a three-month sentence mandated by the Mumbai Metropolitan Court.[19][42] The sentencing caused leaders of all political parties except the BJP and the Shiv Sena to support him.[43] Later, due to public protests, the Government of Maharashtra ordered his release. Hazare wrote a letter to then chief minister Manohar Joshi demanding Gholap's removal for his role in alleged malpractices in the Awami Merchant Bank.[44] Gholap resigned from the cabinet on 27 April 1999.[45]
        
        In 2003 corruption charges were raised by Hazare against four NCP ministers of the Congress-NCP government.[46] He started his fast unto death on 9 August 2003. He ended his fast on 17 August 2003 after then chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde formed a one-man commission headed by the retired justice P. B. Sawant to probe his charges.[47] The P. B. Sawant commission report, submitted on 23 February 2005, indicted Sureshdada Jain, Nawab Malik, and Padmasinh Patil. The report exonerated Vijaykumar Gavit. Jain and Malik resigned from the cabinet in March 2005.[48]
        
        Three trusts headed by Anna Hazare were also indicted in the P. B. Sawant commission report. ₹220,000 (US$2,640) spent by the Hind Swaraj Trust for Anna Hazare's birthday celebrations was concluded by the commission as illegal and amounting to a corrupt practice,[49][50] though Abhay Firodia, an industrialist subsequently donated ₹248,000 (US$2,970) to the trust for that purpose.[51] The setting apart of 11 acres of its land by the trust in favour of the Zilla Parishad without obtaining permission from the charity commissioner was concluded as a case of maladministration. The commission also concluded that the maintenance of accounts of the Bhrashtachar Virodhi Janandolan Trust after 10 November 2001 had not been according to the rules and ₹46,374 (US$560) spent by the Sant Yadavbaba Shikshan Prasarak Mandal Trust for renovating a temple thwarted its object of imparting secular education.[49][50] 
      </p>
      <h3>Right to Information movement</h3>
      <p>
        In the early 2000s Hazare led a movement in Maharashtra state which forced the state government to enact a revised Maharashtra Right to Information Act. This Act was later considered as the base document for the Right to Information Act 2005 (RTI), enacted by the Union Government. It also ensured that the President of India assented to this new Act.[52]

        On 20 July 2006 the Union Cabinet amended the Right to Information Act 2005 to exclude the file noting by the government officials from its purview. Hazare began his fast unto death on 9 August 2006 in Alandi against the proposed amendment. He ended his fast on 19 August 2006, after the government agreed to change its earlier decision.[53]
        
        Regulation of Transfers and Prevention of Delay in Discharge of Official Duties Act
        Before 2006 in the state of Maharashtra, honest government officers were transferred to other places according to ministerial wish, while some corrupt and favoured officials stayed put for decades. Hazare fought for a law whereby a government servant must clear files within a specified time, and transfers must take place only after three years. After many years of Hazare's efforts, on 25 May 2006 Maharashtra announced the Prevention of Delay in Discharge of Official Duties Act 2006. This act provided for disciplinary action against officials who clear files slowly, and enabled monitoring of officials who overstay a post, and for involvement in a corrupt nexus.
        
        This act mandated the government to effect transfers of all government officers and employees, except Class IV workers, no sooner and no later than three years, except in emergency or exceptional circumstances. Maharashtra was the first state to introduce such an act.[30] However, this law was not fully followed.[54][55]
      </p>
      <h3>Campaign against liquor from food grains</h3>
      <p>
        Article 47 of India's Constitution commits the State to raise the standard of living, improve public health and prohibit the consumption of intoxicating drinks and drugs injurious to health.[56][57][58]

        In 2007 Maharashtra rolled out a policy aimed to encourage production of alcohol from food grain to fill the rising demand for industrial alcohol and liquor. It issued 36 licences for distilleries for making alcohol from food grain.[58]
        
        Anna Hazare opposed the government's policy to promote making liquor from food grain. He argued that Maharashtra had to import food, so producing liquor from food grain was inappropriate.[59] One State minister, Laxman Dhoble said that those opposing the use of food grain for the production of liquor were anti-farmer, and that opponents should be beaten with sugarcane sticks.[60][61]
        
        Hazare began fasting at Shirdi, but on 21 March 2010 the government promised to review the policy and Anna ended his 5-day fast.[62] But the government later granted 36 licences and grants of ₹10 (12¢ US) (per litre of alcohol) to politicians or their sons who were engaged in making alcohol from foodgrains. Recipients included Amit and Dheeraj Deshmukh, sons of Union Heavy Industries Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Gopinath Munde's daughter Pankaja Palwe and her husband Charudatta Palwe, sons-in-law of P.V. Narasimha Rao and Rajya Sabha MP Govindrao Adik.[59][63][64] The government approved the licences despite stiff opposition from the planning and finance departments, saying there was a huge demand in other countries for distilled spirits compared to that of molasses.[65] Hazare sued Maharashtra over the policy in the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court. On 20 August 2009 Maharashtra stopped the policy. However, distilleries sanctioned before that date and those who started production within two years of sanction were entitled for subsidies.
        
        On 5 May 2011 the court refused to hear the suit, saying, "not before me, this is a court of law, not a court of justice".[66][67] A Maharashtra Principal Secretary, C.S. Sangeet Rao, stated that no law existed to scrap these licences.[59]
        
      </p>
      <h3>Lokpal Bill movement</h3>
      <p>
        In 2011, Hazare participated in the satyagraha movement campaigning for a stronger anti-corruption Lokpal (ombudsman) bill in the Indian parliament. Known as the Jan Lokpal Bill (People's Ombudsman Bill), it was drafted by N. Santosh Hegde, a former justice of the Supreme Court of India and Lokayukta of Karnataka, Prashant Bhushan, and social activist Arvind Kejriwal. The draft incorporated more stringent provisions and gave wider power to the Lokpal than the government's 2010 draft.[68] These included placing "the Prime Minister within the ambit of the proposed lokpal's powers".
