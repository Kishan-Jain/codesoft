      <h3>Teacher's Day</h3>
      When Radhakrishnan became the President of India, some of his students and friends requested him to allow them to
      celebrate his birthday, on 5 September. <br> He replied,

      Instead of celebrating my birthday, it would be my proud privilege if September 5th is observed as Teachers'
      Day.[35]

      His birthday has since been celebrated as Teacher's Day in India.[web 6]

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (pronunciationⓘ; 5 September 1888 – 17 April 1975; natively Radhakrishnayya) was an
        Indian politician, philosopher and statesman who served as the second president of India from 1962 to 1967. He
        previously served as the first vice president of India from 1952 to 1962. He was the second ambassador of India
        to the Soviet Union from 1949 to 1952. He was also the fourth vice-chancellor of Banaras Hindu University from
        1939 to 1948 and the second vice-chancellor of Andhra University from 1931 to 1936. Radhakrishnan is considered
        one of the most influential and distinguished 20th century scholars of comparative religion and
        philosophy,[2][web 1] he held the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta
        from 1921 to 1932 and Spalding Chair of Eastern Religion and Ethics at University of Oxford from 1936 to
        1952.[3]

        Radhakrishnan's philosophy was grounded in Advaita Vedanta, reinterpreting this tradition for a contemporary
        understanding.[web 1] He defended Hinduism against what he called "uninformed Western criticism",[4]
        contributing to the formation of contemporary Hindu identity.[5] He has been influential in shaping the
        understanding of Hinduism, in both India and the west, and earned a reputation as a bridge-builder between India
        and the West.[6]

        Radhakrishnan was awarded several high awards during his life, including a knighthood in 1931, the Bharat Ratna,
        the highest civilian award in India, in 1954, and honorary membership of the British Royal Order of Merit in
        1963. He was also one of the founders of Helpage India, a non profit organisation for elderly underprivileged in
        India. Radhakrishnan believed that "teachers should be the best minds in the country".[web 2] </p>

      <h2>Early life and education</h2>
      <p>
        Radhakrishnan was born as Sarvepalli Radhakrishnayya[7][8] in a Telugu Niyogi Brahmin family of Sarvepalli
        Veeraswami and Sithamma. He was the fourth born of six siblings (five brothers and one sister),[9] in Tiruttani
        of North Arcot district in the erstwhile Madras Presidency (now in Tiruvallur district of Tamil
        Nadu).[10][11][12][13][14][15] As per his son's biography, he was born out of wedlock, but this was often
        dismissed as rumour arising from village gossip, with his remarkable academic ascent.[16] His family hails from
        Sarvepalli village in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. His early years were spent in Thiruttani and Tirupati.
        His father was a subordinate revenue official in the service of a local Zamindar (local landlord). His primary
        education was at K. V. High School at Thiruttani. In 1896 he moved to the Hermansburg Evangelical Lutheran
        Mission School in Tirupati and Government High Secondary School, Walajapet.[17]

            Education
          </h3>
        </span>
      <p class="content">

        Indian President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan with US President John F. Kennedy in the Oval Office, 1963
        Radhakrishnan was awarded scholarships throughout his academic life. He joined Voorhees College in Vellore for
        his high school education. After his F.A. (First of Arts) class, he joined the Madras Christian College
        (affiliated to the University of Madras) at the age of 16. He graduated from there in 1907, and also finished
        his Masters from the same college.

        Radhakrishnan studied philosophy by chance rather than choice. He had wished to study mathematics. Being a
        financially constrained student, when a cousin who graduated from the same college passed on his philosophy
        textbooks to Radhakrishnan, it automatically decided his academics course.[18][19]

        Sarvepalli wrote his bachelor's degree thesis on "The Ethics of the Vedanta and its Metaphysical
        Presuppositions".[20] It "was intended to be a reply to the charge that the Vedanta system had no room for
        ethics."[21] Two of his professors, Rev. William Meston and Dr. Alfred George Hogg, commended Radhakrishnan's
        dissertation.[citation needed] Radhakrishnan's thesis was published when he was only twenty. According to
        Radhakrishnan himself, the criticism of Hogg and other Christian teachers of Indian culture "disturbed my faith
        and shook the traditional props on which I leaned."[21] Radhakrishnan himself describes how, as a student,
        The challenge of Christian critics impelled me to make a study of Hinduism and find out what is living and what
        is dead in it. My pride as a Hindu, roused by the enterprise and eloquence of Swami Vivekananda, was deeply hurt
        by the treatment accorded to Hinduism in missionary institutions.[4]

        This led him to his critical study of Indian philosophy and religion[21] and a lifelong defence of Hinduism
        against "uninformed Western criticism".[4] At the same time, Radhakrishnan commended Professor Hogg as 'My
        distinguished teacher,'[22] and as "one of the greatest Christian thinkers we had in India.'[23] Besides,
        Professor William Skinner, who was acting Principal of the College, gave a testimonial saying "he is one of the
        best men we have had in the recent years", which enabled him to get the first job in Presidency College. In
        reciprocation, Radhakrishnan dedicated one of his early books to William Skinner.[24]

          The Spirit of Abheda
        </h3>
      </span>
      <p class="content">

        Radhakrishnan expresses his anguish, against the British critics, in The Ethics of the Vedanta.[25] Here he
        wrote, "it has become philosophic fashion of the present day to consider the Vedanta system a non-ethical one."
        He quotes a German-born philologist and Orientalist, who lived and studied in Britain for most of his life, Max
        Muller as stating, "The Vedanta philosophy has not neglected the important sphere of ethics; but on the
        contrary, we find ethics in the beginning, ethics in the middle, and ethics in the end, to say nothing of the
        fact that minds, so engrossed with divine things as Vedanta philosophers, are not likely to fall victims to the
        ordinary temptations of the world, the flesh, and other powers."

        Radhakrishnan then explains how this philosophy requires us (people) to look upon all creations as one. As
        non-different. This is where he introduces "The Spirit of Abheda".[26] He quotes, "In morals, the individual is
        enjoined to cultivate a Spirit of Abheda, or non-difference." Thus he mentions how this "naturally leads to the
        ethics of love and brotherhood".

        "Every other individual is to be regarded as your co-equal, and treated as an end, not a means."

        "The Vedanta requires us to respect human dignity and demands the recognition of man as man."

      <h2>Personal life</h2>
      <p>
        Radhakrishnan was married to Sivakamu[note 1] (1893–1956) in May 1903, a distant cousin, at the age of 16, when
        she was aged 10.[27][28][29] As per tradition the marriage was arranged by the family. The couple had five
        daughters named Padmavati, Rukmini, Sushila, Sundari and Shakuntala. They also had a son named Sarvepalli Gopal
        who went on to a notable career as a historian. Many of Radhakrishnan's family members including his
        grandchildren and great-grandchildren have pursued a wide range of careers in academia, public policy, medicine,
        law, banking, business, publishing and other fields across the world. Former India cricketer & NCA director VVS
        Laxman is his great-grandnephew. Sivakamu died on 26 November 1956. They were married for about 53 years.

        <h3><span class="circle-button">></span>Academic career </h3>
      </span>
      <p class="content">
        In April 1909, Radhakrishnan was appointed to the Department of Philosophy at the Madras Presidency College.
        Thereafter, in 1918, he was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the University of Mysore, where he taught at
        its Maharaja's College, Mysore. [web 3][32] By that time he had written many articles for journals of repute
        like The Quest, Journal of Philosophy and the International Journal of Ethics. He also completed his first book,
        The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore. He believed Tagore's philosophy to be the "genuine manifestation of the
        Indian spirit". His second book, The Reign of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy was published in 1920. <br>

        In 1921 he was appointed as a professor in philosophy to occupy the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral
        Science at the University of Calcutta. He represented the University of Calcutta at the Congress of the
        Universities of the British Empire in June 1926 and the International Congress of Philosophy at Harvard
        University in September 1926. Another important academic event during this period was the invitation to deliver
        the Hibbert Lecture on the ideals of life which he delivered at Manchester College, Oxford in 1929 and which was
        subsequently published in book form as An Idealist View of Life. <br>

        In 1929 Radhakrishnan was invited to take the post vacated by Principal J. Estlin Carpenter at Manchester
        College. This gave him the opportunity to lecture to the students of the University of Oxford on Comparative
        Religion. For his services to education he was knighted by George V in the June 1931 Birthday Honours,[web 4]
        and formally invested with his honour by the Governor-General of India, the Earl of Willingdon, in April
        1932.[web 5] However, he ceased to use the title after Indian independence,[33]: 9  preferring instead his
        academic title of 'Doctor'. <br>
        In 1936 Radhakrishnan was named Spalding Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics at the University of Oxford,
        and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College. That same year, and again in 1937, he was nominated for the Nobel
        Prize in Literature, although this nomination process, as for all laureates, was not public at the time. Further
        nominations for the award would continue steadily into the 1960s. In 1939 Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya invited him
        to succeed him as the Vice-Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University (BHU).[34] He served as its Vice-Chancellor
        till January 1948.

        <h3><span class="circle-button">></span> Political career</h3>
      </span>
      <p class="content">
        Radhakrishnan started his political career "rather late in life", after his successful academic career.[4] His
        international authority preceded his political career. He was one of those stalwarts who attended Andhra
        Mahasabha in 1928 where he seconded the idea of renaming Ceded Districts division of Madras Presidency as
        Rayalaseema. In 1931 he was nominated to the League of Nations Committee for Intellectual Cooperation, where
        after "in Western eyes he was the recognized Hindu authority on Indian ideas and a persuasive interpreter of the
        role of Eastern institutions in contemporary society."[4] <br>

        When India became independent in 1947, Radhakrishnan represented India at UNESCO (1946–52) and was later
        Ambassador of India to the Soviet Union, from 1949 to 1952. He was also elected to the Constituent Assembly of
        India. Radhakrishnan was elected as the first Vice-President of India in 1952, and elected as the second
        President of India (1962–1967). Radhakrishnan did not have a background in the Congress Party, nor was he active
        in the Indian independence movement. He was the politician in shadow.[further explanation needed] His motivation
        lay in his pride of Hindu culture, and the defence of Hinduism against "uninformed Western criticism".[4]
        According to the historian Donald Mackenzie Brown,

          Philosophy
        </h3>
      </span>
      <p class="content">
        Radhakrishnan tried to bridge eastern and western thought,[39] defending Hinduism against "uninformed Western
        criticism",[4] but also incorporating Western philosophical and religious thought.[40]
        <br>
        <strong>Advaita Vedanta</strong><br>
        Radhakrishnan was one of the most prominent spokesmen of Neo-Vedanta.[41][42][43] His metaphysics was grounded
        in Advaita Vedanta, but he reinterpreted Advaita Vedanta for a contemporary understanding.[web 1] He
        acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by
        the absolute or Brahman.[web 1][note 2] Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted Shankara's notion of maya. According to
        Radhakrishnan, maya is not a strict absolute idealism, but "a subjective misperception of the world as
        ultimately real."[web 1]
        <br>
        <strong>Intuition and religious experience</strong><br>
        See also: Mystical experience and Religious experience
        "Intuition", [web 1] synonymously called "religious experience",[web 1] has a central place in Radhakrishnan's
        philosophy as a source of knowledge which is not mediated by conscious thought.[40] His specific interest in
        experience can be traced back to the works of William James (1842–1910), F. H. Bradley (1846–1924), Henri
        Bergson (1859–1941), and Friedrich von Hügel (1852–1925),[40] and to Vivekananda (1863–1902),[45] who had a
        strong influence on Sarvepalli's thought.[46] According to Radhakrishnan, intuition is of a self-certifying
        character (svatassiddha), self-evidencing (svāsaṃvedya) and self-luminous (svayam-prakāsa).[web 1] In his book
        An Idealist View of Life, he made a powerful case for the importance of intuitive thinking as opposed to purely
        intellectual forms of thought.[web 8] According to Radhakrishnan, intuition plays a specific role in all kinds
        of experience.[web 1]
        <br>
        <strong>Radhakrishnan discernes eight sorts of experience</strong>
        <br>
        Cognitive Experience:
        Sense Experience
        Discursive Reasoning
        Intuitive Apprehension
        Psychic Experience
        Aesthetic Experience
        Ethical Experience
        Religious Experience
        <br>
        <strong>Classification of religions</strong>
        <br>
        For Radhakrishnan, theology and creeds are intellectual formulations, and symbols of religious experience or
        "religious intuitions".[web 1] Radhakrishnan qualified the variety of religions hierarchically according to
        their apprehension of "religious experience", giving Advaita Vedanta the highest place:[web 1][note 3]

        The worshippers of the Absolute
        The worshippers of the personal God
        The worshippers of the incarnations like Rama, Kṛiṣhṇa, Buddha
        Those who worship ancestors, deities and sages
        The worshippers of the petty forces and spirits
        Radhakrishnan saw Hinduism as a scientific religion based on facts, apprehended via intuition or religious
        experience.[web 1] According to Radhakrishnan, "if philosophy of religion is to become scientific, it must
        become empirical and found itself on religious experience".[web 1] He saw this empiricism exemplified in the
        Vedas:

        The truths of the ṛṣis are not evolved as the result of logical reasoning or systematic philosophy but are the
        products of spiritual intuition, dṛṣti or vision. The ṛṣis are not so much the authors of the truths recorded in
        the Vedas as the seers who were able to discern the eternal truths by raising their life-spirit to the plane of
        universal spirit. They are the pioneer researchers in the realm of the spirit who saw more in the world than
        their followers. Their utterances are not based on transitory vision but on a continuous experience of resident
        life and power. When the Vedas are regarded as the highest authority, all that is meant is that the most
        exacting of all authorities is the authority of facts.[web 1]

        From his writings collected as The Hindu View of Life, Upton Lectures, Delivered at Manchester College, Oxford,
        1926: "Hinduism insists on our working steadily upwards in improving our knowledge of God. The worshippers of
        the absolute are of the highest rank; second to them are the worshippers of the personal God; then come the
        worshippers of the incarnations of Rama, Krishna, Buddha; below them are those who worship deities, ancestors,
        and sages, and lowest of all are the worshippers of petty forces and spirits. The deities of some men are in
        water (i.e., bathing places), those of the most advanced are in the heavens, those of the children (in religion)
        are in the images of wood and stone, but the sage finds his God in his deeper self. The man of action finds his
        God in fire, the man of feeling in the heart, and the feeble minded in the idol, but the strong in spirit find
        God everywhere". The seers see the supreme in the self, and not the images."
